# Overview

The software is a Black Jack game that uses no monitary input but still allows you to wager credits in the game.

Purpose of this software was to experiment with building a simple card game that I enjoyed playing with my siblings. I also was inspired to make a version that I could play by myself when I got bored in class that would not require monitary means. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
