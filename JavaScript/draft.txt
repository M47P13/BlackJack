# Project Overview

I have developed a simple Blackjack game in JavaScript and HTML. This project serves as a learning exercise to enhance my skills as a software engineer. The game allows players to compete against a computer dealer, with the goal of getting as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. 

## Purpose

The purpose of creating this software is to:

1. **Improve JavaScript Skills:** This project provides an opportunity to practice and improve my JavaScript programming skills, event handling, and logic implementation.

2. **Interactive Web Development:** It allows me to create an interactive web application. Understanding how to create user interfaces and handle user interactions is crucial.

3. **Problem Solving:** Developing a game like Blackjack involves solving complex problems related to card handling, scoring, and game logic. It's a great way to enhance problem-solving skills.

# Development Environment

I used the following tools and technologies to develop this software:

- **HTML:** The game's user interface is built using HTML, which provides the structure of the web page.

- **CSS:**  CSS is used for styling and layout.

- **JavaScript:** The core functionality of the game is implemented in JavaScript. This includes shuffling the deck, handling card values, managing player and dealer hands, and determining the game's outcome.

- **Code Editor:** I used a code editor - Visual Studio Code to write and debug the code.

- **Web Browser:** To test and run the game, I used a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

- **YouTube:** I used YouTube to host and share the demo video of the software in action.

By working on this project, I aimed to gain practical experience in web development and JavaScript programming, as well as to demonstrate my ability to create interactive and engaging web applications.
